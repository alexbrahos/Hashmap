To run the program, execute "make run", and the program will compile and run. The program will then prompt you for a seed to generate the 1000 random numbers. The numbers will be generated, and then you will have to type in the row number that you want to print. When the program asks you to type "EXIT" or anything else, EXIT must be in all caps to actually exit properly. Just typing ENTER does not count as anything else, so some string has to be entered in to continue.
